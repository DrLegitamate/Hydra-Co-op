# Hydra Co-op Launcher

> Project maintained by DrLegitamate

## Welcome to Hydra Co-op! üéÆü§ù

Hydra Co-op is a tool designed for Linux to simplify setting up local split-screen co-operative gameplay by launching and managing multiple instances of a single game. It handles routing input from multiple physical devices to dedicated virtual devices, arranging game windows, emulating UDP network traffic between instances, and supports launching Windows games via Proton.

Run multiple game instances, manage inputs, and create a virtual network‚Äîall in one place! Perfect for local multiplayer setups, streaming, or testing networked games where instances need to run simultaneously on the same machine.

## ‚ú® Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Multiple Instances**: Launch multiple instances of a single game executable simultaneously
- üåê **UDP Network Emulation**: Route UDP network packets between game instances communicating on localhost using configurable ports
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Input Routing**: Route input from dedicated physical devices (keyboards, mice, gamepads) to individual virtual input devices
- ü™ü **Automatic Window Management**: Resize and position game instance windows according to selected layouts
- üç∑ **Proton Integration**: Launch Windows games on Linux
- üìù **Customizable Settings**: Configure via config.toml file or command-line arguments
- üñ±Ô∏è **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use visual interface for configuration
- üìã **Command-Line Interface**: Scriptable interface for launching with specified parameters

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DrLegitamate/Hydra-Co-op.git
   cd Hydra-Co-op
   ```

2. **Install Rust and Cargo** (if not already installed):
   - Follow instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Use your distribution's package manager to install GTK 4 and libevdev development libraries

4. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
   The executable will be at `./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher`

5. **Set up Permissions**:

   sudo usermod -aG input,uinput $USER
   # Log out and log back in for group changes to take effect
   ```

   Create a udev rule file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules`:
   ```
   KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="uinput"
   ```

6. **Load uinput Module**:
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe uinput
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Launch the GUI:
```bash
./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher
# Or
./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher --gui
```

The GUI provides:
- Number of Players selection
- Profile Name field (for future use)
- Game Executable selection
- Split-Screen Layout options
- Proton toggle for Windows games
- Input device assignment for each player
- Save and Launch buttons

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher \
    --game-executable <FILE> \
    --instances <NUMBER> \
    --input-devices <DEVICE_NAME_FOR_PLAYER1> \
    [--input-devices <DEVICE_NAME_FOR_PLAYER2>] \
    # ... add --input-devices for each player ... \
    --layout <LAYOUT> \
    [--proton] \
    [--debug]
```

**Arguments**:
- `--game-executable <FILE>`: Path to the game executable
- `--instances <NUMBER>`: Number of game instances to launch
- `--input-devices <DEVICE_NAME>`: Physical input device name for each player
  - Find names using `ls /dev/input/by-id/` or `evtest /dev/input/eventX`
  - Use `"Auto-detect"` to automatically assign the next available device
- `--layout <LAYOUT>`: Window layout style (`horizontal`, `vertical`, or `custom`)
- `--proton`: Use Proton to launch Windows games
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging

**Example** (2 Players, Horizontal Split):
```bash
./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher \
    --game-executable "/path/to/my/game.exe" \
    --instances 2 \
    --input-devices "usb-Logitech_Gamepad_F310-event-joystick" \
    --input-devices "Auto-detect" \
    --layout horizontal \
    --proton
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File (config.toml)

The launcher loads settings from `config.toml` at startup. By default, it looks for this file in the current working directory.

You can specify a different configuration file:
```bash
CONFIG_PATH="/home/user/.config/hydra/game_profile.toml" ./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher
```

**Example config.toml**:
```toml
# Path to the game executable
game_paths = [
    "/path/to/your/game/executable"
]

# Input assignments for each player instance
input_mappings = [
    "Auto-detect",
    "Auto-detect",
    # Add one entry per player
]

# Window layout: "horizontal", "vertical", or "custom"
window_layout = "horizontal" 

# UDP ports for game instances communication
network_ports = [
    7777,
    7778,
    # Add one port per instance
]

# Set to true to use Proton for launching Windows games
use_proton = false
```

Settings provided via command-line arguments override settings from the configuration file.

## üñºÔ∏è Window Layouts

The window manager automatically arranges game windows:

### Horizontal Split
Splits the screen horizontally, stacking windows side-by-side:
```
+-------+-------+
|       |       |
| Inst0 | Inst1 |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
```

### Vertical Split
Splits the screen vertically, stacking windows top-to-bottom:
```
+---------------+
|     Inst0     |
+---------------+
|     Inst1     |
+---------------+
```

### Custom Layout
(Future feature) Currently acts as default/unmanaged layout.

## üåê Network Emulation

The built-in UDP network emulator is designed for games that communicate between instances on localhost using UDP.

Configure the `network_ports` in your `config.toml` with the UDP ports that your game instances use for communication. The emulator will set up internal routing to redirect packets between the game instances.

**Note**: This is a basic UDP forwarding mechanism. It may not work for all games, especially those using TCP, broadcast/multicast, or complex network discovery.

## üç∑ Proton Support

To launch Windows game executables:
- Check "Use Proton" in the GUI or use the `--proton` flag in the CLI
- Ensure Proton is installed and accessible on your system

You can specify the Proton path:
```bash
PROTON_PATH="/path/to/your/Proton/dist/bin/proton" ./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher --game-executable "/path/to/WindowsGame.exe" --instances 2 --proton ...
```

## üïπÔ∏è Input Management

To map specific physical input devices to game instances, find their names or identifiers:

1. Using stable identifiers (recommended):
   ```bash
   ls /dev/input/by-id/
   ```

2. Using device events:
   ```bash
   evtest /dev/input/eventX  # Try different X values to find your device
   ```

Use these names with the `--input-devices` CLI argument or select them from the dropdown menus in the GUI.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Permission Errors**: 
  - Ensure your user is in the `input` and `uinput` groups
  - Verify the uinput kernel module is loaded
  - Check udev rules are set up correctly

- **Proton Games Not Launching**:
  - Ensure Proton is installed
  - Try specifying its path via `PROTON_PATH` environment variable
  - Set `PROTON_LOG=1` for detailed logs: `PROTON_LOG=1 ./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher ...`

- **Window Arrangement Issues**:
  - Ensure game windows are fully loaded and visible
  - Some games may not be compatible with automatic window management

- **Input Not Working**:
  - Verify correct input devices are selected
  - Check that uinput kernel module is loaded
  - Verify permissions for /dev/uinput
  - Test physical devices with evtest

- **Network Communication Issues**:
  - Verify network_ports in config.toml match the game's UDP ports
  - Check firewall settings if applicable

### Enable Debug Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher [options...]
# Or use the --debug flag:
./target/release/hydra-coop-launcher --debug [options...]
```

You can specify a log file: `LOG_PATH="/path/to/your/log.txt"`
